-   ### Design
    -   #### Color Scheme
        -   The main colors used are white(elegance) and dark grey(cutting edge).
    -   #### Typography
        -   The main fonts I used are Lobster and Roboto Condensed for a simple but elegant presentation.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is the best part. The main image throughout the site gives a fun nature perspective. I wanted the customer to feel welcomed and comfortable.
